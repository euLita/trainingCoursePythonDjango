First Django Project

### Python and Django Course

Regarding this, well, I joined a project that the company made available to the development team. At the time, I was part of another team, specifically in networking, and theoretically, I wouldn't have been eligible to participate. However, I asked my supervisor for permission to join because my aspiration is to be part of the development team. It was a project of a very advanced level for me, and I only realized on the way that I couldn't keep up with the process and stopped at this stage. Nevertheless, it was a valuable learning experience; the exchange with colleagues enabled me to learn new tips and tools. Through this interaction, I also managed to secure a simple project to work on, where I am currently employed. Unfortunately, I cannot publicly version it due to security reasons.
